                <p>Hi, my name is Beth! An aspiring web developer with a focus on front-end development. 
                    I am currently completing a coding bootcamp and have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node.js.
                    I enjoy finding solutions to problems, creating exciting experiences for myself and others, and
                    continuously learning new technologies. When I am not coding, I enjoy partaking in any kind of art
                    like painting, ceramics or cooking!
                </p>
